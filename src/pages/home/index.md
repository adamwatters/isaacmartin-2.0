#### Exploring

Recently I have been taking an interest in static site generators, particularly when paired with React & a CMS. This site is built in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), GraphQL & [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). I wrote a little about my experience building this website using the JAM stack.
